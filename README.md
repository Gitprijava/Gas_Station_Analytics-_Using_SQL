# Gas_Station_Analytics-_Using_SQL

In this case study, we looked at the data associated to the transactions of a gas station.

We have considered following metrics:
1. The breakdown of the gas fills for the different vehicles.
2. The number of gas fills for members and non-members.
3. The gas fill breakdown based on the fuel type.
4. The ratio between the fuel and vehicle costs.

STEPS INVOLVED:

    • Not all the data which we need will be stored in one table. That is why we need to construct table schemas.
    
    • In this case, we will look at a simple table schema consisting of two tables and how to correctly define the primary and foreign keys before carrying out our analysis.
    
    • The table schema constructed will involve using two tables.
    
    • To create the master table, the ‘Gas Station Fills’ and ‘Vehicles’ tables are joined on the foreign key (Vehicle ID).
    
    • For further analysis, we have altered the constraints of the tables to NOT NULL and also added primary key and Foreign keys to them.We have used joins,CTE,Clauses,Aggregate functions,etc.
